# arduino-walldraw
A "hanging" drawbot / wall plotter

Having seen several implementations of this, I thought I'd have my own go at it.

Based on existing implementations including:
 - MaslowCNC (https://www.maslowcnc.com/)
 - Polargraph (http://www.polargraph.co.uk)
 - MakelAngelo (http://www.makelangelo.com/ https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:26298 https://github.com/MarginallyClever/Makelangelo-software )
